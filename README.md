# ARD - Anti-Rage Device
#### By Richard Collins

## About the project
ARD is a side project, I came up with to prevent getting angry at games. It consists of a Raspberry Pi (I use a Pi Zero), vibration sensor, LED and power source.
The server code is to be run on the rapsberry pi with the modules hooked up and the client is run on computer. When the sensor is activated it sends a code from server to client side which closes the game.
